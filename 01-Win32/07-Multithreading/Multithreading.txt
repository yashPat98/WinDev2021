Windows
* Process is the container (daba)
* Thread is contained in the container (undir) 

IX
* There is no thread in unix based system
* Fork -> Process -> can be mapped as thread
* Fork and Exec -> Full Blown Process

* Process - Running instance of program is called process
* Thread - A Running entity inside a container called process, is called as a thread
* Every Process has atleast 1 thread i.e main thread / primary thread 

01 -> Thread is part of "SAME" program
02 -> Thread share memory of parent 
03 -> Every thread has its own stack (text and data can be shared between threads)
04 -> Every thread has its own message queue   
05 -> Threads share file opened by the parent
06 -> Every thread has its own CPU quantum
07 -> Any thread can kill any other thread of same process, 
      parent thread can kill any of child thread at any time, 
      OS can kill any thread at any time without intimation.
08 -> Though above thing is true dont kill a thread explicitely 
      let the thread die its own death after completion of its associated function
09 -> Though thread shares everything with parent, it is not true for sibling thread by default
      If siblings wants to share they have to use a special mechanishm called as TLS(thread local storage)
10 -> looking at some of points we may think that thread is not independent BUT 
      Every thread is an independent entity


Multithreading functions 

val = GetExitCodeThread()
01 -> TerminateThread(hThread, val) - kill from outside thread 
02 -> ExitThread(DWORD) - kill from inside thread
03 -> SuspendThread() - ref count increases
04 -> ResumeThread() - ref count decreases
05 -> Sleep(time) 

//must not use
06 -> GetPriorityClass()
07 -> SetPriorityClass()
08 -> GetPriority() 
09 -> SetPriority()
