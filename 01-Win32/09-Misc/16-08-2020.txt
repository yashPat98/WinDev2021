//Five methods to import data from dll

1 -> __declaspec(export) int i;

2 -> def file      
     i DATA; 
     func FUNCTION; (default)         

3  -> Shared memory
    //globally
    char str[255] to be export

    #pragma data_seg("temp")         //name of shared memory which we want to give to os
    char str[255] = {'\0'};          //data MUST be initialized , must be in data_seg pragma and tell linker this data is prt of shrd mem
    #pragma data_seg()
 
    #pragma comment(linker, "/section:temp, RWS")

4 -> make the data as retured value of function

5 -> COM (component object model)

* Resource only DLL
1->rc files + header file
2->cpp file (dll main)

* DLL main
1-> IDE
2-> No Switch case
3-> any two pairs process or thread
4-> all cases
